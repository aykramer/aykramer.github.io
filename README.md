## Portfolio

<!---You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aykramer/aykramer.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.--->

You can find the examples for my work below. (A more detailed portfolio/blog is coming soon..)

### Web Scraping

US Patent Office provides detailed data for patent filings. By using BeautifulSoup python library, I retrieved patent data belonging to the University of Washington.

### Monte Carlo Sampling from Spatial Datasets



### Tableau Visualization

Tableau is a very practical tool to visualize and analyze the data. I used Tableau to conduct a data analysis of the publications in the Lone Woman and Last Indians archives. The project included webscrapping the data, cleaning the data and visualizing it.

The visualization includes a timeline for the frequency of the publications, frequency of the tropes and publications and using filters.

### Spatial Data

I used python script to organize metadata for scanned tiles of aerial images. I stored the metadata in geojson file format to be called using Terraformer library of ESRI. Finally, I used ArcGIS Javascript API to call the images according to the user's query for the county and the year.
